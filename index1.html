      <p class="roles">As personal you may be scientist, janitor, engineer, or doctor. You must survive the Containment Breach and escape the foundation. Forces will help you. Avoid SCPs, Serpent`s Hand, CI(Chaos Incergency). GRU, UNIGOC and class-D are netural( they can also kill you). You will need lvl. 3 card. Do not go to 914. Just find this keycard.
As class-D, also don`t go to 914, becase SCPs can easily find you here. Find lvl. 2 keycard, then get lvl. 3. If you find CI, they will help you to escape. Personal is netural. Someone else are hostile.</p>
